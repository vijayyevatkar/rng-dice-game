## Game Rules

1. Each player rolls the dice, starting with Player 1.
2. The user, after each roll of the dice, can decide to roll again, or hold.
3. When a dice is rolled, 2 things can happen:
   - If 1 is rolled, the user's current score resets to 0, and the turn automatically switches to the other user.
   - Any other number gets added to the current score of the user playing.
4. If the user holds, his current score gets added to the total score and the turn moves to the other user.
5. Whoever reaches the score of 50 first, wins the game!
